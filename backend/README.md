## Available Scripts

In the backend directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app on the specified port (3001 locally)
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

You may see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run devStart`

**This is prefered when developing**

This runs the app in the development mode. With `npm start`, you will have to stop the server and start it again for any changes you make to take effect. But if you run this script, the server will restart automatically when you make any changes

### Notes

-   **Server will not connect to database if connected to school's internet**
- ^ above does not matter right now because database is not active yet
